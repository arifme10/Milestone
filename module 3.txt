1.  The print() function returns None in Python or if any matter is mentoned in that, that one displays in that.

2. By using input() to take user input and print() to display the output.

3. 	data = [44, 5.33, "Arif", True, 6+1h, None]
	safest-list = []
	for x in data:
    		try:
        		safest-list.append(x)
    		except:
        		pass
	print(safest-list)

4. 	data = [55, 4.11, "Hannu", True, 9+4a, None]
	safe-items = []
	for x in data:
    		try:
        		safe-items.append(x)
    		except:
        		pass
	my_tuple = tuple(safe-items)
	print(my_tuple)

8. List is mutable, slower, and written with [], while Tuple is immutable, faster, and written with ().
